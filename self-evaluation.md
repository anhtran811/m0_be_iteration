# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*After the small group lessons, I felt a lot more comfortable with the `each` method
but with any new topic, I was worried how I would do on my own (without real time
guidance from my group and instructor). After reviewing my notes from class, I was able to complete the practice assignment pretty quickly.*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*The group lesson really helped break down the `each` method which I found extremely helpful. I still struggle with the terminology a bit but will keep practicing. I productively struggled when I couldn't figure out why the first question was printing out all of the names, rather than individual names. I referred to my notes and realized that inside my string interpolation had my variable inside rather than the block variable.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I definitely still need to practice talking out what I am doing in full sentences while using proper terminology and vocabulary. I still stumble over my words when trying to explain what my process was. I will work on this by reading my solutions as a full sentence rather than just typing it out. It will take me extra time as I will need to find my words rather than just typing out a solution; however, I don't think I will need to block out extra time.*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I don't have any questions at this time, the class session was very thorough so once I got to the homework assignment, I felt fairly comfortable. I will make sure to ask questions in the slack channel if something comes up.*
